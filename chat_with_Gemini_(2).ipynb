S.O. Temu  (SPM) .  \\nProsecutor : Mr. Ngetich  \\nBoth the accused, Meshack Mutua and Benard Mulee, and their representative Mr. Kibet \\nwere present in court.   \\nWitness 1 : Meshack Mutua Musioka Occupation : businessman who deals in fruits.  \\nOn 30th Sep 2018, his day began in Eldoret where he operates his business. He woke up  at 5 \\nam and went to the Soko Mjinga market in his car, KCD 124N a Toyota Wish, where he \\nbought 7 sacks of oranges. He then went to Kapsabet market to set up shop. He got to \\nKapsabet before 7 and went about his business as usual. By noon, he had been able to sell 5 \\nsacks of orange s leaving only 2. He had been planning to go home to Machakos on that day \\nand the remaining oranges were to be dropped off on his way to Machakos,  so he closed \\nshop and began his journey.  \\nHe stopped in Lanet Barracks  at around 3 PM where he took a meal. As he was going back to \\nhis car, a stranger approached him and asked if the witness could give him a lift to Nairobi. \\nThe witness accepted but at a fee of 300. When they were in Westlands, the stranger \\n(Benard Mulee) r equested that he be dropped off at Willson airport as he was going to \\nLangata, he offered to pay more and the witness agreed. They arrived at a Shell petrol \\nstation near Wilson airport, where Benard alighted and gave the Meshack  500 shillings.  \\nSince they were in a petrol station, Meshack decided to relieve himself before resuming his \\njourney. When he c ame back to his car, the movement of people around his car caught his \\nattention. Before he could react, the front driver's door was opened and he was tossed \\noutside. His keys were taken away and when he inquired what was going on and was told \\nhe’d be informed later. He was put in a boot where he found 2 other people.  \\nThey were taken to an office where the people who took him identified themselves as KWS \\nand he was informed of the charges. The officers took their statement , and the accused and \\none of the other two he found in the boot were taken to Langata police station where they \\nwere booked. They were brought to court and Meshack’s car KCD 124N and another car KBD \\n208D were presented before the court.  He requested his oranges be released as they are \\nperishable s. On the back seat of the KBD 208D, there was  a bag which  contained ivory .  \\nTheir charges were read to them and he pleaded not guilty. he was given the statements \\nwhere he learnt the name of the other accused was Vincent. Vincent was later released and\\n\\nappeared before the court as a witness. Meshack was then taken to industrial area prison \\nwhere after a week he met Bernard.  \\nDuring cross -examination, Meshack stated that he did not know any of the other parties \\ninvolved in the case . He also stated that the communication data proved that he had no \\nprior communication with the other parties.  \\n \\nWitness 2 : Benard Mulee Nduku    Occupation:   Officer posted in Nakuru  \\nOn 30th Sep 2018, he went optimum to ask for leave from his superior, which he was \\ngranted. He packed and got a lift from one of the barrack vehicles and was dropped off at \\nLanet barracks. The witness was short on money as the fare was a bit above his budget. This \\nmade him look for alternative means of transport and that is when he saw a person with a \\nToyota Wish. He approached the driver and inquired if he was  going to Nairobi and then \\nasked for a lift . The driver agreed at a price of 300 Kenyan shillings.  \\nOn the way, the witness received a call from one of his colleagues who learnt of his leave \\nrequest, he inquired where Benard was and then proceeded to request a favour from \\nBenard. The colleague has a brother  (Alex)  and brother -in-law who at the time were \\ntravelling to Nairobi from Nyeri, and the colleague requested that Benard meet with them \\nand direct them around Nairobi since they don’t know Nairobi well. Benard agreed and the \\ncolleague sent him his brother’s number and also added that he is sending another number. \\nThe second number belonged to the person Alex was supposed to meet up with .  \\nWhen they were near Westlands, Alex called and inquired where Benard was , he said \\nPangani was familiar to him and he would be okay meeting up with him there . 10 minutes \\nafter Alex called, a lady called Gladys called and asked where Benard was, she said she was \\nthe person Alex was supposed to meet up with . She requested that they call her when he \\nmeets up with Alex.  \\nWhen they met up, they called Gladys who requested they meet in a shell station at/near \\nWilson Airport. Since he was getting dropped off, Benard requested that Alex follow them to \\nthe meeting point. When they arrived at the shell station, he paid the driver and proceeded  \\nto introduce  himself to the lady and she told him he could go. Benard crossed the road and \\ntook a matatu to town where he charged his phone.  \\nAt 8 P .m., his colleague called him and told him his brother and brother -in-law were \\narrested. He asked why and was told he would be informed later on. After that, Benard \\nresumed work and after five days his superior told him there were things they needed to talk \\nabout. On that same day, some officers came and had a meeting with his superior, the \\nsergeant and the corporal were called to the meeting and he was later  summoned by the \\ncorporal who told him he needed to be in that meeting. In the meeting, the offi cers \\nidentified themselves as KWS officers who were investigating an ivory case. He was relieved \\nof duty and was escorted by the officers to KWS Nakuru but refused to make a statement as \\nhe did not understand what was going on.  \\nHe was transferred to Langata police station where he was booked and taken to court the \\nnext day.  He was then taken to an industrial area prison  \\nIn the cross -examination, he said that Gladys identified herself as a police officer when they \\nmet at the Shell police station, but she had not identified herself over the phone. The\\n\\nprosecutor highlighted a disparity in Meshack and Benard’s statements stating Benard spoke \\nof meeting up with Alex and Alex following them but Meshack didn’t mention that.  \\n \\nThe defence ended the defence hearing and requested a mention for the submission of files.  \\nThe next court date is 29th January 2024\")]"
